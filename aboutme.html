            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi there! My name is Morgan and I'm a full stack developer (in progress). My interest in web development initially started after trialling some casual online codings classes and built from there. 
                Professionally I have a background as a chemical and materials engineer and looked at coding as a way to upskill, but also learn new ways of problem solving and interpreting information. Whilst working in the field, I observed that tech is still underutilised and there's plenty of space to introduce new ways to communicate information. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I also currently work as a freelance content creator, primarily within the beauty space, producing visual projects for clients along with written pieces. Whilst the field has always had a strong focus on design, I'm increasingly seeing the crossover between tech and beauty. 
                Apps that interpret images of the face to determine information about the skin, complex algorithms to assist in finding the correct shade match of a product or interactive visuals to help explain complicated skin functions - all of these exist and the opportunity to develop in the space in increasingly rapidly.

            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p>Within web development, I have a more speicifc range of interests including:
                <ul>
                    <li>UX Design</li>
                    <li>UI Design</li>
                    <li>Search Engine Optimisation: I currently do some of this on a freelance basis for brands, from the content side of the coin and think it's a largely underused marketing tool</li>
                    <li>Content Development</li>
                    <li>App Design and Development></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Outside of web development, I have a number of more personal interests that I would love to see overlap with my professional life</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The beauty industry: I currently have a modest online following that I create visual content for, including product reviews and tutorial style posts. I also freelance as a writer for a number of online publications</li>
                    <li>Food and Cooking: a favourite weekend past time is finding new restaturants to try out or recipes to challenge my current skills</li>
                    <li>Reading</li>
                    <li>Logic Puzzles and Problem Solving Games</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
